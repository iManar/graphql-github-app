# GraphQL GitHubApp

In case the app displays error after loading, that would mean the used `GitHub` access token has been expired! 
To make it work please visit `https://github.com/settings/tokens` and generate new acccess token and then paste in inside `Constants.swift` file to e able to test the app smoothly.

Also, you can always change the username to any `GitHub` user and it will fetch their repos.
For example, I occasionally used `hwillson` to display repos stars and make sure it works.
